## Introduction
This tutorial will guide you step by step to build an efficient and modern personal blog on GitHub, covering:

- Blog framework selection: Based on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, combined with the beautiful and powerful [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme.
- Automated deployment: Use GitHub Actions to achieve continuous integration and automatic publishing in a dual-repo mode. No manual operation is required—just push your code to go live automatically.
- Search integration: Integrate [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for full-site content search, and use automated scripts/processes to keep the index in sync in real time, improving content retrieval experience.
- Comment system: Enable blog comments with Giscus.

This tutorial will cover environment preparation, project structure, theme configuration, CI/CD automation, search integration, comment integration, common issues, and optimization tips, helping you quickly own a high-quality personal blog.

Although the process seems long, it is not complicated. After following along, you can have a personal blog with a github.io domain without renting a server. The blog will automatically categorize your posts by tags and categories, support full-site search, and even enable comments. All these features are completely free—just spend a little time and you can have your own blog on GitHub, one of the most visited websites in the world! Go for it!
